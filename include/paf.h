 * @version 0.0 [API]
 * @version 1.0.1 [Implementation]
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * The Pathfinder Client Library API is used to access one or more
 * Pathfinder service discovery domains, either as a service producer
 * or consumer.
 *
 * All the functions in this API are non-blocking in the sense that no
 * blocking system calls are made.
 *
 * For simplicity, the library implementing this API is referred to as
 * @c libpaf, although there might be other implementations as well.
 *
 * @section domains Service Discovery Domains
 *
 * A Pathfinder service discovery domain is a namespace shared by all
 * Pathfinder clients attached to that domain. A service publish by
 * one client can be seen by all other clients attached to that
 * domain. A domain is served by one or more Pathfinder server
 * instances.
 *
 * In order to participate in a domain, an application issues
 * paf_attach() with the appropriate service discovery domain name. It
 * need not know what servers are currently serving that domain.
 *
 * @subsection domain_mapping Domain Configuration
 *
 * The mapping between a service discovery domain name and the set of
 * addresses to the Pathfinder servers serving this domain is kept in
 * a file. The configuration for a particular domain name must be
 * stored in a file with the same name as the domain, and be located
 * in the domain files directory.  The compile-time default location
 * is is @c /run/paf/domains.d/.
 *
 * The directory may contain an arbitrary number of domains.
 *
 * In case the domain file does not exist at the time of the
 * paf_attach() call, @c libpaf will periodically check if it has been
 * created.
 *
 * In case the file is modified (e.g., a server is added, removed or
 * has its address changed), the file will be re-read by @c libpaf.
 * If the file is removed, the set of servers is considered empty.
 *
 * The environment variable @c PAF_DOMAINS may set in case a
 * non-standard directory is preferred over the default.
 *
 * @subsubsection domain_file_format File Format
 * 
 * @c libpaf supports two file formats. Either the contents of the
 * file is a newline-separated list of XCM addresses, or a JSON
 * object.
 *
 * The newline-separated format allows for comments. In this format,
 * empty lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored. JSON does not
 * support comments.
 *
 * A domain file in the JSON format must contain a root JSON object,
 * with a key "servers". The value of "servers" must be an array of
 * zero or more JSON objects, each representing a server.
 *
 * The server object must have a key "address", with a string value.
 *
 * In case the transport protocol uses TLS, three optional keys may be
 * present in the server object:
 *
 * - "tlsCertificateFile": the leaf certificate to use.
 * - "tlsKeyFile": the private key corresponding to the leaf certificate.
 * - "tlsTrustedCaFile": a file containing the trusted CA certificates.
 *
 * In case some/all of the certificate file related keys are left out,
 * @c libpaf will fall back to using the XCM defaults.
 *
 * Below is an example of a domain file in JSON format:
 * @code
 * {
 *   "servers": [
 *     {
 *       "address": "tls:1.2.3.4:4444",
 *       "tlsCertificateFile": "/etc/paf/certs/cert.pem",
 *       "tlsKeyFile": "/etc/paf/certs/key.pem",
 *       "tlsTrustedCaFile": "/etc/paf/certs/ca-bundle.pem"
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "address": "tls:5.6.7.8:8888"
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "address": "ux:foo"
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The same configuration (minus the certificate-related
 * configuration), but in the newline-separated format:
 * @code
 * "tls:1.2.3.4:4444"
 * "tls:5.6.7.8:8888"
 * "ux:foo"
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsubsection rescan Domain File Rescan
 *
 * For all domains the application currently has attached to, @c
 * libpaf tracks domain file changes. This check is performed
 * periodically every ~5 s. A small random component is added to avoid
 * load spikes, in case there are many clients on the same system.
 *
 * This default interval may be changed by setting the @c PAF_RESCAN
 * environment variable. The value a floating point number (in s). If
 * set to zero, the rescanning is disabled.
 *
 * @section reconnect Connection Reestablishment
 *
 * In case the connection to a server is lost, or never was
 * successfully established in the first place, @c libpaf will perform
 * another attempt at a later time.
 *
 * @c libpaf uses exponential back-off. The first retry is scheduled
 * to occur after 10 ms. Every failed attempt double the retry
 * interval, up to a maximum of 5 s. These two defaults may be changed
 * by setting the @c PAF_RECONNECT_MIN and/or @c PAF_RECONNECT_MAX
 * environment variables.
 *
 * @section ttl Service TTL
 *
 * A service publish via the library has a time-to-live (TTL) of 30
 * s. This default may be changed by setting the @c PAF_TTL
 * environment variable, beforing the paf_publish() call. The TTL must
 * be an non-negative integer.
 *
 * @section tracing Tracing
 *
 * @c libpaf comes with built-in support for tracing. The library
 * supports writing traces to stderr in human-readable format, or
 * direct them to LTTng. The former is always available, and the
 * latter is available if the library is built with LTTng support.
 *
 * To enable stderr-type tracing, set the @c PAF_DEBUG environment
 * variable to "1", before starting the application.
 *
 * To enabled LTTng tracing, enable the relevant libpaf LTTng
 * tracepoints.
 *
 * @section thread_safety Multi-thread Safety
 *
 * All API calls are multi-thread (MT) safe when called on different
 * context (for paf.h API calls) or service properties (for
 * paf_props.h API calls). Thus, one thread may safely call
 * paf_publish(), while another thread calls the same (or a different)
 * paf_*() function, but on another context.
 *
 * No API calls are MT safe when called on the same context or service
 * properties. For that to work, external synchronization (e.g., a
 * mutex lock) is required.
